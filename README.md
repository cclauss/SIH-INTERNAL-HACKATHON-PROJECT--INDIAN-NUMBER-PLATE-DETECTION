# What does it do?
* Once set up correctly, this tool takes an images as input, this image must be the picture of License plate of Indian Vehicles or else, you can train it according to your own dataset.
* It converts License plate number from the images to string.

* First of all clone the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models">models repository</a> of tensorflow.
* Download and install <a href="https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg">LabelImg</a> software made by <a href="https://github.com/tzutalin">darrenl</a>.
